    Bulbasaur[a] is a Grass/Poison-type Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. It is the first
    in the franchise's monster index, called a Pokédex. Designed by Atsuko Nishida,[1] Bulbasaur debuted in Pocket
    Monsters: Red and Green (Pokémon Red and Blue outside Japan) as a starter Pokémon. Since then, it has reappeared in
    subsequent sequels, spin-off games, related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise.

    Known as the Seed Pokémon, Bulbasaur can survive for days solely on sunlight. It likes to take a nap in the
    sunshine. While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to grow. It is a central
    character in the Pokémon anime, being one of Ash Ketchum's main Pokémon for the first season, and a different one
    later being obtained by May. It is featured in various manga, and is owned by protagonist Red in the Pokémon
    Adventures manga. Bulbasaur has been featured in myriad pieces of merchandise, including toys, key chains, and plush
    dolls.

    Bulbasaur can evolve into Ivysaur at level 16, and can further evolve into Venusaur at level 32. Venusaur can also
    evolve into Mega Venusaur if the player equips it with a Venusaurite, but this feature was only first added to the
    Pokémon games in Pokémon X and Y.

    The website Bulbapedia, a spin-off of Wikipedia dedicated solely to the Pokémon franchise, is named after Bulbasaur.
