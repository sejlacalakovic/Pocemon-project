    Squirtle[4] (/ˈskwɜːrtəl/), known as Zenigame (ゼニガメ) in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's
    Pokémon franchise. It was designed by Atsuko Nishida.[1] Its name was changed from Zenigame to Squirtle during the
    English localization of the series in order to give it a "clever and descriptive name." Its name is composed of
    squir- from squirt and -tle from Turtle. In animated appearances, Squirtle is voiced in Japanese by Rikako Aikawa
    and in English localizations by Eric Stuart, and later Michele Knotz. Squirtle, in the anime, never evolved for
    reasons which are never truly explained by the creators.

    In the main series games, Squirtle can evolve into Wartortle at level 16 or 14 depending what game you are playing,
    which can further evolve into Blastoise at level 36 or 34. It is known as the "Tiny Turtle Pokémon".[5] It also
    appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
