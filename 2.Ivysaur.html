    Ivysaur's name is a combination of the English word ivy = ivy and the Greek word sauros = lizard (like a dinosaur).
    Its Japanese name is Fushigisou, which comes from the Japanese words fushigi = mysterious and kusa = grass.

    Biological characteristics
    Ivysaur is an evolved form of Bulbasaur. It is still awkward and stocky, but is slightly larger, with more developed
    canines, and can sometimes stand on its hind legs. What used to be a bulb on his back is now a flower bud. The size
    of the bud can increase under the influence of sunlight, forcing Ivysaur to walk on all fours. Although the bulb is
    now an early flower form, it is not known whether Ivysaur is a plant or an animal. In contrast to the bulb, the bud
    appears to draw energy from Ivysaur and perform photosynthesis by absorbing solar energy. Carrying extra weight
    strengthens his legs preparing him for the final stage of growth. The bud creates a pleasant scent when it is ready
    to bloom and at that point Ivysaur will develop into Venusaur.

    In video games
    Ivysaura cannot be found in the wild and can be obtained by training Bulbasaur up to level 16 or by exchange.
    Bulbasaur is only available in the original games and their remake versions and as a prize at Pokémon Stadium. Due
    to its rarity, Ivysaur is highly sought after by Pokémon collectors. Also, it can be obtained at Pokémon Yellow,
    originally developing Bulbasaura which can be obtained in the city of Ceruleanu if Pikachu is satisfied enough with
    the coach.

    In the animated series
    Ivysaur has appeared twice in the animated series. In episode 51, “Bulbasaur’s Mysterious Garden,” Ash Ketchum and
    company find themselves at the site where the Bulbasaurs evolve, under the protection of Venusaur, where they
    witness a natural cycle in which numerous Bulbasaurs evolve into Ivysaurs. Ash defended the rights of his Bulbasaur
    who did not want to develop. The second appearance was in the episode "Judgment Day", where Ash, Misty and Brock
    come across a Kanto coach with all three starters in their developed stages.

    Despite the fact that he was Ash’s Pokémon longer than anyone else (except Pikachu), his Bulbasaur was never
    interested in evolving into Ivysaur and Ash respected his decision.
