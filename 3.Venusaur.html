    Venusaur (/ˈviːnəˌsɔːr/), known in Japan as Fushigibana (フシギバナ), is a Grass/Poison-type Pokémon species in Nintendo
    and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Venusaur first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red
    and Green and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed
    adaptations of the franchise. It is known as the Seed Pokémon. Venusaur is capable of Mega Evolution, which allows
    it to transform into Mega Venusaur. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, Venusaur has a Gigantmax form, allowing it to
    transform into a large, special form of itself when it Dynamaxes. It evolves from Ivysaur, which itself evolves from
    Bulbasaur.
